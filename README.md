### Getting Started

Clone the repo into your local directory using the "Code" button above. Open a terminal and change directory to the repo.

Create a .env file located in the root of the backend folder formatted similarly to the .env.example file located in the same directory.

Run the following commands to run the application locally:
```js
//Inside of Terminal
npm install
cd backend/
npx dotenv sequelize db:migrate
npx dotenv sequelize-cli db:seed:all
npm start

//Inside of a Different Terminal
cd ../frontend/
npm start
```
Upon completion, the site should launch in your local browser. Recommended: Google Chrome.
NOTE: the backend and frontend npm start's must both be running on separate terminals in order to operate the application locally.
